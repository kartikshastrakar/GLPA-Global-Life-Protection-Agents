# GLPA: Global Life Protection Agents

**An Early-Warning & Human-Escalation AI for Population-Level Risk Prevention.**

## 📌 Project Overview
The Global Life Protection Agents (GLPA) system is a multi-agent orchestration built on **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**. It is designed to assist NGOs and humanitarian organizations by detecting early signals of regional distress and potential instability through macro-level data analysis.

### The Problem
Humanitarian crises often escalate faster than manual monitoring can track. There is a need for an objective, high-speed system that identifies "stress signals" in population data without compromising individual privacy.

### The Solution: Agentic AI
GLPA uses two specialized AI agents that collaborate to ensure accuracy and ethics:
1. **Signal Awareness Agent:** Scans public news and NGO reports for macro-trends.
2. **Context & Ethics Agent:** Audits findings to strip bias and ensure safety compliance.

## 🚫 Project Boundaries (Explicit Exclusions)
To ensure responsible use, this system follows a strict "Safety-First" policy:
- **No Individual Tracking:** We do not collect, process, or store PII (Names, Addresses, ID numbers).
- **No Diagnosis:** The system does not provide clinical or medical diagnoses.
- **No Enforcement:** The AI does not trigger law enforcement or tactical operations.
- **Prevention Only:** Focus is strictly on resource scaling and humanitarian outreach.
